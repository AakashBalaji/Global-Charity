What is Global Charity?

Global Charity is a new app that encourages charitable acts through easy access and competition. The goal is to essentially create a brand new app that incorporates features from other apps that are currently available with modifications. This app includes push notification for recent major events and a friend system to track competition between individuals on the amount they contribute to a charity. There is also a desktop version available to those who prefer to donate via computer.

Why was this App Made?

Disastrous world events and oppressive policies incite harm on people all over the world every day. The problem is that there are plenty of people in this world with a small amount of money that they can donate to help out the cause. Everything counts. Unfortunately, most people are not aware of these events and do not know how to contribute even though they wanted to. Looking for a good charity that properly allocates their fund to the situation is hard to find, and our goal is to make this easier while educating donors about the events. With this in mind, our teamâ€™s intention to create an app that would make it much more easier to donate and help out charitable foundations during major events.
